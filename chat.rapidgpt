The `first_one_found` variable is used to track if a '1' bit has been found in the input array. The for loop iterates from the most significant bit to the least significant bit of the input array. Once a '1' bit is found, the output array is updated by concatenating the bits from the found '1' bit to the MSB position. The break statement is used to exit the loop once the first '1' bit is found.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance!",

If you want to generate an 8-bit binary representation instead of 64 bits, you can use the `$itor` function to convert the integer to a binary string and then extract the desired 8 bits from it. Here's an updated version of the function:\n\n```verilog\nfunction logic [7:0] int_to_binary(input integer value);\n  logic [7:0] binary_value;\n  string binary_string;\n  \n  begin\n    binary_string = $itor(value, 2);\n    binary_value = binary_string.substr(binary_string.len() - 7, 8);\n    return binary_value;\n  end\nendfunction\n```\n\nIn this updated version, the `$itor` function is used to convert the integer to a binary string format with a base of 2. The resulting binary string is stored in the `binary_string` variable.\n\nThen, the `substr` function is used to extract the last 8 bits from the `binary_string`, starting from the 7th bit from the end. This ensures that the resulting `binary_value` is 8 bits in length.\n\nFinally, the `binary_value` is returned as the output of the function.\n\nYou can use this updated function in your Verilog code to convert integer values to their 8-bit binary representations. For example:\n\n```verilog\ninteger my_integer = 42;\nlogic [7:0] binary_representation;\n\n// Convert integer to 8-bit binary using the function\nbinary_representation = int_to_binary(my_integer);\n\n$display(\"Binary representation of %d: %b\", my_integer, binary_representation);\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_integer` is assigned a value of 42.

In big endian format, the most significant bit (MSB) is stored at the lowest index position, and the least significant bit (LSB) is stored at the highest index position.\n\nFor example, if you use `$sformatf(\"%0d\", value)` to convert the decimal value 42 to binary, the resulting binary representation would be \"00101010\". In this binary string, the MSB (0) is stored at index 0, and the LSB (1) is stored at index 7.\n\nIt's important to note that the endianness of the binary representation is determined by the `$sformatf` function itself and is independent of the underlying hardware architecture.\n\nIf you require little endian format, where the LSB is stored at the lowest index position, you can use the `reverse` function in Verilog to reverse the order of the binary representation. Here's an example:\n\n```verilog\ninteger my_integer = 42;\nlogic [7:0] binary_representation;\n\n// Convert integer to 8-bit binary using the function\nbinary_representation = int_to_binary(my_integer);\n\n// Reverse the order of the binary representation to little endian\nbinary_representation = binary_representation.reverse();\n\n$display(\"Little endian binary representation of %d: %b\", my_integer, binary_representation);\n```\n\nIn this example, after converting the integer to its 8-bit binary representation using the `int_to_binary` function, the `reverse` function is used to reverse the order of the bits in the `binary_representation` variable. This results in the little endian binary representation.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!",
